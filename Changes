        This needs a whole lot of TLC. In the meantime, I've at least
        brought it up to date with Moose 2.0.

        Moved VERSION info to MX::T
        Moved perigrin to ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS rather than AUTHOR
          - perigrin very much helped to lay out the project, but he shouldn't
            get blamed for any of my mistakes in the implementation :)
        Tests:
          - Fixed cross platform issues (thanks Taro Nishino RT#41168)
        lib/MooseX/Templated/View.pm
          - Fixed handling of single param in render()
        lib/MooseX/Templated/View/TT.pm
          - Added more info to the croak message when TT->process fails
